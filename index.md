## About Me

I work as a Junior Research Fellow with [Prof. Anirban Dasgupta](https://sites.google.com/site/anirbandasgupta) at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, India. My research interest broadly lies in the area of machine learning. 

I received the Director's Silver Medal and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2020 from IIT Gandhinagar. Previously, I had interned at Caltech (with [Dr. Ashish Mahabal](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~aam/) in 2019), Microsoft Research India (with [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/) in 2019), and IISc (with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/) in 2017).
