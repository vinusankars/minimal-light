## About Me

I am a II-year Computer Science PhD student at [The University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/vinu){:target="_blank"} working with [Prof. Soheil Feizi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~sfeizi/){:target="_blank"}. My research interest lies in the area of privacy and security in deep learning.
 
I received the prestigious Director's Silver Medal and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2020 from [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}. I was a Junior Research Fellow with [Prof. Anirban Dasgupta](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/datascience/anirban-dasgupta/){:target="_blank"} at IIT Gandhinagar, India in the [Data Science Lab](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/datascience/){:target="_blank"}. Previously, I had interned at Caltech, Microsoft Research India, and IISc.

## Personal Stuff

I come from the beautiful town [Kollam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kollam){:target="_blank"} in Kerala. In my free time, I love to sing and play the ukulele. Check out my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqtXUoA6m6mDXuoHyMy31PQ){:target="_blank"} and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vinusankars/){:target="_blank"} pages for my musical covers. I also love playing badminton, soccer, ultimate frisbee, and cricket.
