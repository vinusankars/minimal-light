## About Me

I work as a Junior Research Fellow with [Prof. Anirban Dasgupta](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/datascience/anirban-dasgupta/){:target="_blank"} at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in the [Data Science Lab](https://labs.iitgn.ac.in/datascience/){:target="_blank"}. I will be joining [The University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu/){:target="_blank"} in Fall 2021 to pursue my MS/PhD in CS. My research interest broadly lies in the area of machine learning. I am interested in designing robust, energy- and compute- efficient machine learning algorithms. 
 
I received the prestigious Director's Silver Medal and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering in 2020 from IIT Gandhinagar. Previously, I had interned at Caltech, Pasadena (with [Dr. Ashish Mahabal](https://sites.astro.caltech.edu/~aam/){:target="_blank"} in 2019), Microsoft Research India, Bangalore (with [Dr. Harsha Vardhan Simhadri](http://harsha-simhadri.org/){:target="_blank"} in 2019), and IISc, Bangalore (with [Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula](https://sites.google.com/site/chandrasekharseelamantula/){:target="_blank"} in 2017, 2018). I did my undergraduate project courses with [Prof. Nithin George](https://sites.google.com/iitgn.ac.in/nvg/){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Joycee Mekie](http://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} on "Functional Link Networks for Active Noise Cancellation" and "Approximate Multipliers for FPGAs".

## Personal

I come from the beautiful town Kollam in Kerala. In my free time, I love to sing and play ukulele. See my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqtXUoA6m6mDXuoHyMy31PQ){:target="_blank"} and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vinusankars/){:target="_blank"} pages for the covers that I have made. I also love playing badminton, soccer, ultimate frisbee, and cricket.
